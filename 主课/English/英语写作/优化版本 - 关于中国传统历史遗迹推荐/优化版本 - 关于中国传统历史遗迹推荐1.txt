How is it going? It has been a while since we last spoke. Regarding your interest in Chinese scenic spots and historic sites, I would like to wholeheartedly advocate visiting Xi’an for the following compelling reasons.

Xi’an is not only one of the cradles of Chinese civilization but also the city that has served as the capital for the most dynasties. If you visit, you will see Chinese elements and cultural features everywhere.

For scenic spots and historic sites, I heartily recommend that you visit the Terracotta Army. As you set foot on the steps of the Terracotta Army, you will be immersed in the atmosphere it creates and gain a deeper understanding of this real treasure in human history. I hope you search for related background knowledge before your visit; otherwise, you may miss many important details.

The Terracotta Army represents a time-honored craft. If you ask someone what takes Xi’an’s historical significance to a new height, I believe they will answer the Terracotta Army.

Does this scenic spot appeal to you? If you are interested, you can follow my advice. You won’t be disappointed, I promise!
