How is it going? It has been a while since we last spoke, and I was genuinely delighted to receive your letter. Regarding your interest in attractions and local culture in China, I would like to wholeheartedly recommend Xi’an and one of its most iconic scenic spots – the Terracotta Army.

Xi’an is a city that blends contemporary diversity with time-honored cultural heritage. If you visit, you’ll witness a beautiful integration of ancient architecture and modern urban technology.

In the evening, you’ll have the chance to taste a variety of colorful, aromatic, and delicious Chinese foods. The local restaurants and street snacks will offer a truly flavorful experience.

Why Xi’an instead of any other city? The answer lies in the irreplaceable Terracotta Army – not only a cradle of Chinese civilization but also a true treasure of human history. As you step into the site, you will be fully immersed in the magnificent atmosphere created by thousands of clay soldiers.

I recommend booking your ticket online in advance and checking the official website for more background knowledge. Hiring a local guide can also help you understand this site more deeply.

Does this recommendation appeal to you? If you're interested, follow my advice. You won’t be disappointed, I promise!
