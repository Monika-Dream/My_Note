How is it going? It has been a while since we last spoke. I was truly delighted to hear from you. Knowing (that) you want to understand some Chinese traditional crafts, I would like to recommend paper-cutting to you based on the following reasons.

Paper-cutting is a kind of traditional handicraft. People usually make it before the New Year to decorate doors and windows for good luck and happiness.

Nowadays, paper-cutting has various patterns in folk crafts. If you search for its background, you may find people cutting different shapes and using them to decorate their rooms. As tradition evolves into fashion, traditional paper-cutting is likely to cater to contemporary teenagers. They believe that adding modern elements to traditional designs can bring more joy to their lives.

If you want to fully understand the concept of paper-cutting or other traditional crafts, I recommend you go to the countryside to learn from local artisans. Rural villages preserve more traditional crafts than urban areas.

Does this paper-cutting appeal to you? If you are interested, you can follow my advice. I hope you totally immerse yourself in Chinese traditional culture. You wonâ€™t be disappointed, I promise!
