How is it going? It has been a while since we last spoke. Regarding your interest in typical Chinese masterpieces, I would like to wholeheartedly advocate Chinese poetry for the following compelling reasons.

While tradition evolves into modernity, Chinese poetry has gradually become a time-honored cultural heritage, enriched with abundant dynastic masterpieces.

For ancient poetry, I heartily recommend Li Bai's works. If you search online for what elevates traditional Chinese poetry to a new height, many would answer "Li Bai's poetry." His poems possess an irreplaceable charm, combining melancholy with magnificence.

From childhood to adulthood, many Chinese people grow up with Li Bai's poetry. If you read more deeply and fully understand the concepts in his poems, you will see that Chinese traditional customs and features can be found everywhere in them.

Does this recommendation appeal to you? If you are interested, you can follow my advice. You wonâ€™t be disappointed, I promise!
