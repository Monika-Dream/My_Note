How is it going? It has been a while since we last spoke. Regarding your interest in traveling to China, I would like to wholeheartedly advocate visiting Xi’an for the following compelling reasons.

Xi’an has a long and rich history and is home to the largest museum of culture and art in China. If you visit this city, I highly recommend the Terracotta Army because it is truly a treasure of human history.

If you ask what represents the peak of Chinese history, many people would say the Terracotta Army, as it stands out among all other historical heritages. It was buried underground for centuries before historians excavated it and displayed it to the public. To fully appreciate its historical significance, I suggest researching its background before your visit. Otherwise, you may not understand its true value!

As you set foot on the steps of the Terracotta Army, you will have a great chance to immerse yourself in the profoundness of Chinese history.

Does this attraction appeal to you? If you are interested, you can follow my advice. You won’t be disappointed, I promise!
